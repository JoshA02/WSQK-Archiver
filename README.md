# WSQK Scraper

## Purpose
This project was built to archive the short-lived Stranger Things-themed radio station (WSQK), before its conclusion in January 2026.

Although the program is entirely functional, I have omitted all scraped media files from this repo to respect their respective owners.

- Node.js

## Setup

```git clone https://github.com/JoshA02/WSQK-Archiver.git```

2. Install Dependencies
